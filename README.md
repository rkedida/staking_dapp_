# staking_dapp_


This project is a simple decentralized application (DApp) for staking tokens. It's built with React for the frontend, and Truffle & Ganache for handling the Ethereum smart contracts.

## Prerequisites

You need to have installed:

- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) (`npm install -g truffle`)
- [Ganache CLI](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) (`npm install -g ganache-cli`)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download.html) browser extension

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rkedida/staking_dapp_.git
```

# Install dependencies

Navigate into the new folder and install dependencies:

```
cd staking_dapp
npm install
```

## Compile and migrate the smart contracts
First, start Ganache CLI:

```
ganache-cli -d
```

Then, compile and migrate the smart contracts:

```
truffle compile
truffle migrate
```

## Configure MetaMask
- Install and open MetaMask in your browser.

- Create a new Custom RPC network with the following settings:
  Network Name: Local Ganache
  New RPC URL: http://127.0.0.1:8545
  Chain ID: 1337

Once the network is set up, import an account using a private key from one of the accounts generated by Ganache CLI.
